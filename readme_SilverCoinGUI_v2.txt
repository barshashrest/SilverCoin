Classic SilverCoin game where the goal is to be the last player to have a move.
The game is completed when there are no more moves i.e. all coins have been brought to the left of the screen.

Player clicks on coin to move and places it at any open space to the left as long as there is no other coin blocking that space.  After the player's turn is done, he or she presses space bar to let the computer play.
After the user presses space bar, the coin that the computer wants to move gets highlighted to blue, then there is a delay of 1.5 seconds, after which the coin is moved to where the computer wants it to, whereby the color of the blue coin changes back to silver again. So this is the extra feature that I have in the game.
